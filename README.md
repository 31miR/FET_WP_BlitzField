# About the project
This is a project that's a part of Windows Programming course at Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Tuzla.
The task is to make an app/game using WINAPI.

# About the app
This is a top down fighting game where you can jump and slash with your character. There are 4 levels in it, and you can
finish all of them in about 15 minutes.
To control your character:
W/A/S/D - move top/left/down/right
SPACE - slash
LEFT MOUSE CLICK - dash to cursor (or as close as possible).
Every level you finish for the first time gives you a point that you can use to level up your character.

# What's in this repository
The repository contains only the code required for compiling this project (assuming you are compiling on windows). The resource/ directory
is not in this repo and the game will not work properly without it (however, I cannot push the resource files because of copyright reasons).
> I might add the resource files in the future when I change them (the bitmaps and music) to something I've made, or something that's not copyrighted.

# Where are all the commits?
The project code, that was written with a colleague, was not inside the git repo [oops]. Hence, it was just copied when it worked.
